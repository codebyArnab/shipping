Shipping Route Optimization
This project is a web-based tool for calculating the optimal shipping route between two points on a world map using Dijkstra's and A* algorithms. The route is visualized as a smooth, blue dotted line. The user can click on the map to select the start and destination points, and the optimal route is calculated and displayed.

Features
Interactive world map with the ability to select start and destination points.
Uses Dijkstra's and A* algorithms to calculate the optimal shipping route.
Smooth, dotted line visualizes the path on the map.
Adjustable grid size for more precise routing.
Reset button to clear the map and start a new calculation.

Technologies Used
Frontend:
HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web page.
CSS: Styles the page and map for a clean and responsive layout.
JavaScript: Handles user interactions, pathfinding algorithms, and rendering the map and route.
Leaflet.js: A popular open-source JavaScript library for rendering maps and handling user interactions.
Algorithms:
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path between two points on a grid.
A* Algorithm: An optimized version of Dijkstra’s algorithm that uses heuristics for faster results.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you only need a web browser. The project is a client-side application and does not require a backend.

1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shipping-route-optimization.git
2. Open the project in your browser
Once you’ve cloned the project, navigate to the project directory and open the index.html file in your web browser.

bash
Copy code
cd shipping-route-optimization
open index.html
3. Run the application
Open the index.html in your browser.
Click on any two points on the map to set the start and destination.
Click the Find Route button to calculate the optimal path.
Click the Reset button to clear the map and select new points.
4. Modifying the grid size (optional)
If you wish to adjust the grid size for more detailed paths, you can modify the GRID_SIZE variable in the JavaScript code. Larger grid sizes will provide smoother paths but may require more processing time.

javascript
Copy code
const GRID_SIZE = 50; // Change to your desired grid size
Usage
Select Start and Destination:
Click on the map to choose the start point and destination point.
Calculate the Optimal Route:
After selecting the points, press the Find Route button to calculate and visualize the optimal shipping route using either Dijkstra's or A* algorithm.
Reset:
Click on the Reset button to clear the current path and start over with new points.
Key Algorithms Used
Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph by visiting nodes in increasing distance from the source node. It works well in unweighted grids and is guaranteed to find the shortest path.

A* Algorithm
A* (A-star) is an optimization of Dijkstra's algorithm that uses heuristics to guide its search for the shortest path, which often makes it faster than Dijkstra in finding optimal routes.

Grid System
The map is divided into a grid system. The user clicks on grid squares to mark start and destination points. The grid size can be adjusted to make the routes smoother and more precise.
